### Questions:
>Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code? Add your answer to chapter_2/Readme.md

I was curious when I saw this used while watching Pragmatic Studios. So I looked for it in the Menus. I found it under the menu Code>Comment with Line Comment. You simply select the lines you wish to convert, and perform this conversion.  
So, the key combo is Command + /.
