# Learn Ruby the Hard Way
## Chapter Zero
------

### Terminal Output:

>In the section "OS X: What You Should See", the author provides a copy of his Terminal output.  You should do the same, but add the output to a Readme.md file in the chapter_0 directory.
>
>Bonus points if you can figure out how to make the Markdown output "look good".

Here's my output:

```
    ➜  lrthw_exercises  ruby -v
    ruby 2.1.5p273 (2014-11-13 revision 48405) [x86_64-darwin14.0]
    ➜  lrthw_exercises  mkdir chapter_zero
    ➜  lrthw_exercises  cd chapter_zero
    ➜  chapter_zero  touch Readme.md
    ➜  chapter_zero  ls
    Readme.md
    ➜  chapter_zero
```

### Questions:

> Provide a link in your Readme.md that links to the documentation for the following classes:
>
> *  Array
> *  Hash
> *  Chronic (Rubygem)
>
> Find two other relative links and add those to the Readme.md as well.

* [Array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Array.html)
* [Hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Hash.html)
* [Chronic (Rubygem)](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic)
* [Kernel Class (where sprintf is found)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/Kernel.html)

Indented the lines of terminal code to look prettier.
Changed the links to reflect the 2.1.5 version of Ruby instead.
