# Learn Ruby the Hard Way
## Chapter Twelve

### Study Questions:

> Try out the .to_f operation. What does .to_f do?

That converts an object to a float. A float keeps track of all the decimals, too. Takes much more memory, comparatively.

> To play with .to_f more, make a small script that asks for some money and gives back 10% of it. If I give your script 103.4 (dollars), your script gives me back 10.34 in change.
