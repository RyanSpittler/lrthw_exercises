# Learn Ruby the Hard Way
## Chapter One
------

### Comments:
I chose to alter Rubocop to not pay attention to the use of double-quoted strings. After reading [a student's test on which is faster](http://bayendor.github.io/blog/2013/08/28/make-mine-a-single-on-the-use-of-quotation-marks/), the student actually found that double-quoted strings is *faster*, not slower than singe-quoted strings.  
In those instances where I might prefer to use double-quoted strings, I prefer Rubocop to let me be. I may use single- or double- quoted strings as I see fit for style.  
By the way, I changed this *before* I performed the exercises. I wanted to be able to focus on the other offenses.
