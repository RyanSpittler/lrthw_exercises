# Learn Ruby the Hard Way
## Intro

### Question 1:

> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

The three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know are:  
1. Reading and Writing  
2. Attention to Detail  
3. Spotting Differences  

------

### Question 2:
> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

#### 1. Reading and Writing

   - Just like with every language, it takes time working with the language to learn it. Without spending time, it will be difficult to understand the code that others write, let alone our own code.  
   - Not to mention, you need to spend time with a keyboard in order to learn how to type.

#### 2. Attention to Detail

   - If you can learn to pay attention to the small things, you will be able to learn the right way. Code has many nuances, and coding incorrectly can result in big changes (or bugs).

#### 3. Spotting Differences

   - This is essential when learning to make sure you can type the things requested. This remains essential when coding in the future, because it helps find bugs.

### Question 3:
> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

When you learn, repetition helps your brain put it into memory. If you Copy and Paste, you are not putting the exercises into muscle memory.

------

### Question 4:
> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Practice is the only way to continually improve a skill. Persistence helps you continue to practice, even when it is difficult and your skill does not seem to be good enough yet.
